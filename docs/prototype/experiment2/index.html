        <!-- 1. AIM -->
        <p>1. AIM : ✓ Experiment whether variables integrate beetween JS scripts in a HTML file</p>

        <br><hr><br>
        <!-- 1st Prototype -->

        <script src="../experiment1/data.js"></script>
        <script src="index.js"></script>

        <h3>Your data should load under this text:</h3>

        <h3 id="data" style="color:red;"></h3> <!-- Output goes in this line -->

        <!-- 1st Prototype ✓ successfully shown that JS variable integrates beetween scripts -->
        <!-- END OF 1st PROTOTYPE -->

        <!-- 2. CONCLUSION -->

        <p>2. CONCLUSION: Variables do integrate beetween JS scripts with constraint that both file is included in a HTML file. Note that the order of which script is referenced first in the HTML file does not matter.</p>
